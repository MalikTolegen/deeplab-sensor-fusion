## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA 12.2+ (for GPU acceleration)
- cuDNN 8.0+
- NVIDIA GPU with at least 12GB VRAM (for training)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deeplab-sensor-fusion.git
   cd deeplab-sensor-fusion
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dataset Preparation

1. Organize your dataset in the following structure:
   ```
   dataset/
   ├── train/
   │   ├── images/        # RGB images
   │   ├── masks/         # Segmentation masks
   │   └── sensors/       # Sensor data (e.g., depth, LiDAR)
   └── val/
       ├── images/
       ├── masks/
       └── sensors/
   ```

2. Update the dataset paths and sensor configuration in `config/model_cfg.py`

## Usage

### Single Experiment

Run a single training experiment with the default configuration:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Run Multiple Experiments

Use the experiment runner to test different configurations:
```bash
python experiment_runner.py
```
This will run experiments with different batch sizes and pruning configurations, saving results in the `experiments` directory.

### Analyze Results

After running experiments, analyze and visualize the results:
```bash
python analyze_results.py
```

### TensorBoard Visualization

Monitor training progress with TensorBoard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=experiments
```

### Key Configuration Options

In `config/model_cfg.py`:
- `MODEL_CFG`: Model architecture and training parameters
- `PRUNING_CFG`: Pruning configuration (enabled, target sparsity, etc.)
- `DATA_CFG`: Dataset paths and preprocessing settings
- `TRAIN_CFG`: Training hyperparameters (batch size, epochs, etc.)

### Model Checkpoints

- Best model (by validation IoU): `experiments/[experiment_name]/best_model.pth`
- Checkpoints: Saved every 5 epochs in the experiment directory
- Training logs: TensorBoard events and CSV metrics in the experiment directory

```python
from utils.quantization_utils import quantize_model, save_quantized_model

# Load your trained model
model = load_model('path/to/model.pth')

# Quantize the model
quantized_model = quantize_model(model, calib_data_loader)

# Save the quantized model
save_quantized_model(quantized_model, 'quantized_model.pt', example_input_tensor)
```

## Configuration

### Model Configuration (`config/model_cfg.py`)
- Model architecture and hyperparameters
- Data paths and augmentation
- Training parameters
- Device configuration (CPU/GPU)

### Optimization Configuration (`config/optimization_cfg.py`)
- Quantization settings (QAT/PTQ, bit-width, observers)
- Pruning parameters (amount, method, schedule)
- Model fusion options

## Performance

### Optimization Results
